# The Q

The Q is a pickleball queue application developed exclusively for players in the Phoenix area. Built with SvelteKit, Supabase, and TailwindCSS, The Q offers an intuitive interface to organize and manage your games. Currently, the project is in its beta phase, and while most features are fully functional, users may experience a few bugs.

## Planned Features

We're working hard to bring you the following features. They are currently a work in progress:

- [ ] **Pickleball Queue Management:** We're developing an intuitive system to manage your pickleball queue with ease. Quick actions such as "Start Game" and "Quick Join" are in the works to allow for efficient game management.

- [ ] **Reporting Mechanism:** To maintain a healthy and fair community, we're setting up a reporting action feature. This feature will allow users to report if other games are not taking the court in a timely manner, or if certain players are abusing the system. Offending parties can then be removed to ensure a positive experience for all users.

- [ ] **About Page:** An "About" page is being prepared to provide users with more information about our application and the team behind it.

- [ ] **FAQ Page:** We're putting together an FAQ section to answer common questions and help users get the most out of our application.

- [ ] **Contact Page:** We're designing a "Contact" page to make it easier for users to get in touch with us for support or feedback.
